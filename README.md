# Build it Bigger

In this project, I will create an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Could Endpoints. 
Developed as part of my [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).
Was given the starter code in the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud867/tree/master/FinalProject).

##What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. You'll learn to:

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
